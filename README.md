# Simple Weather App

This is a simple weather app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to enter a location and fetches the current weather information for that location using the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). The app displays key weather data such as temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed.
